The course **"C# OOP"** will teach you the **principles of object-oriented programming (OOP)**, to work with **classes and objects**, to use **object-oriented modeling** and to build **hierarchies of classes**. The basic principles of OOP such as **abstraction** (interfaces, abstract classes), **encapsulation**, **inheritance** and **polymorphism** will be studied. We will go into the most commonly used **design patterns**. We will look at component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of **Test Driven Development (TDD)**, the use of **reflection**, and the **use of events**.
